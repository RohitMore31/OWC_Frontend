<p>Using a CD/CI methodology can help to ensure that changes to the code are frequently tested and integrated, reducing the risk of errors and enabling quicker and more reliable releases. Separating the frontend and backend deployment can improve the scalability and reliability of the application.

Vercel is a popular cloud platform for deploying frontend applications built with ReactJS, while Render is a popular cloud platform for deploying backend services. Both platforms offer features and benefits that can make the deployment process smoother and more efficient, and using them together can help create a powerful and reliable application.
